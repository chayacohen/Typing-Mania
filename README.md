Typing Mania is a game that provides a fun challenge as well as enhances your typing skills. 

Goal: The goal of the game is to type the words on the screen before they reach the bottom. When you type in the correct word, the corresponding word will be

How To Play: In the provided textbox, type in a word that matches one of the words on the screen. Click on the submit button (or hit enter on your keyboard)
